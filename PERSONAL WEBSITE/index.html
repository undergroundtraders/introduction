    <h1>Trader99 will show you how trading can change your life.</h1>
    <em><p>Make your life your own. <strong>No excuses.</strong></p></em>
    <strong>Do not go back to working for someone else.  Take money out of Wall Street!</strong>
    <p>I want to make you rich by understanding how to trade.  If you know how to trade, you can understand your entire life.  People who trade respect themselves and do not let money control them.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Don't tell yourself that you can not make it, if you can learn to live as long as you have, you have always been learning, this is no different.  Here is what you need to tell yourself.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Life is trading.  You trade everyday, whether you know it or not.</li>
  <br>
  <li>There is nothing wrong with you making more money.  You deserve to.</li>
  <br>
  <li>You can become an amazing trader.</li>

</ol>

<p>The more you know you can do it, the better your chances are.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you that you need to spend big bucks just to learn something this simple.  In my book, I have over 100 chart examples.  After you go through 100 of them, you are ready to start your demo account.  Trade 100 trades using this method and do not divert from it.  After 100 trades, you will realise how boring and easy it is to make money trading.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Spend your money wisely and always donate some to charity. Karma is real.</p>
